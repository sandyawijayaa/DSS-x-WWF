Over 40 practitioners from nine countries attended the workshop, which was organized by GSLEP and the Government of Nepal.

Climate change was included as a driver that had direct impacts on the snow leopard, but also exacerbated existing threats like over-grazing, poaching and retaliatory killing. The groups then prioritized threats and mitigation strategies using criteria such as cost, feasibility, and whether the strategy would be effective in all of the climate scenarios. The workshop was supported by the Snow Leopard Trust and the WWF Conservation and Adaptation in Asia’s High Mountains Project, which is funded by USAID. Nepal Tracking the Snow Leopard A female snow leopard is fitted with a GPS-collar in Nepal’s Himalayas. In late April, the first female snow leopard to be fitted with a satellite GPS collar in the Nepal Himalaya was captured, collared, and released. This young snow leopard was named Lapchhemba, after the revered local deity of the mountains, whose pet is, fittingly, a snow leopard.

The survey found that in the period from 2000-2015, 67 snow leopards were reported killed in just two national parks in Gilgit-Baltistan. However, the good news is that snow leopard killings are on a downward trend.

In addition to farming, the Chon Kyzyl-Suu Valley is also an important livestock grazing area, with about 20,000 head of livestock occupying the valley. Key grazing issues identified will be addressed in the watershed management plan in a manner that addresses long term pasture ecosystem resilience in the face of a changing climate. 4 Issue #2 | July 2016 Page 4 India A Community Comes Together to Keep Its Lake Pristine North Sikkim’s sacred Gurudongmar Lake is located about 5150 meters above sea level. Each year it attracts throngs of domestic tourists and pilgrims. However, this has resulted in large amounts of trash being dumped at the lake, which has become a growing problem. In order to address this problem, the Lachen Tourism Development Committee, together with WWF-India started an annual lake cleanup campaign in 2011. That initial.\\\n","  ANSWER: 1.

To help mitigate these concerns, schools that successfully implemented BMDs recommend engaging a wide set of stakeholders (influential teachers, parents, staff, administrators, as well as students) in the pre- and post-implementation stages to: (a) deliver training on the benefits, challenges, and use-applications of BMDs with school staff, teachers, and students, and address questions pre- and pre-implementation (such as concerns around spillage, refilling bags, and other new labor requirements); (b) host a launch event to help build excitement and awareness alongside school sustainability/green teams and student clubs; (c) work with green teams and student clubs to help track data when conducting milk waste audits; (d) leverage the Cost Savings Estimate Calculator to build a business case that projects potential cost savings against start-up costs; (e) integrate BMDs into larger sustainability strategies and include food service teams in the planning process for zero-waste and sustainability goals.\",\n"," '1.

They learned how much, and why product was left in the field and gained insights into what was possibly marketable.
