It also focuses on the importance of good governance by governments, communities, and industry, and the effectiveness of protected areas in preventing deforestation.

Fundación Vida Silvestre Argentina and WWF have proposed a concept to reduce deforestation and conversion of critical ecosystems, which could revolutionize strategies for climate impact and biodiversity loss. The Argentinian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries and The Argentinian Beef Promotion Institute (IPCVA) are exploring the possibility of making all exports in Argentina\\'s beef commodity supply chain free of deforestation and other ecosystem conversion (DCF). This could lead to a global market shift and position Argentina as a global leader in DCF beef. Governments and businesses need to reduce GHG emissions to meet climate commitments, and companies can offer incentives to producers who meet criteria for commitments. Argentina has implemented protectionist measures to reduce exports and keep prices low for domestic consumption, but due to increased demand from China for animal protein, beef exports have increased rapidly. Argentina has a traceability system in place that is well-positioned to support DCF beef requirements, and is pivotal in preventing future disruptions.

WWF and local nonprofits have helped communities reintroduce wildlife, create strong governance and financial management structures, and develop relationships with the private sector. Joint-venture lodges in Namibia are a successful model that splits revenue between the community and private owners.\"],\n",

              "  \" This paper examines the social impacts of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification in the Congo Basin. It assesses the differences between certified and non-certified forest management units (FMUs) in terms of working and living conditions, the effectiveness and legitimacy of institutions set up to regulate relationships between logging companies and neighbouring communities, and the local populations' rights to and customary uses of forests. Results suggest that certified FMUs are associated with better working and living conditions, active local institutions, benefit-sharing mechanisms, and more open and dynamic contact between company staff and the local population. The study concluded that certified FMUs are sourcing timber from FMUs where not only legally mandated social standards are implemented, but also voluntary standards that are superior and more effective.\"],\n",

The project focused on integrated conservation, climate adaptation, water resource management, natural resource management, and livelihood activities at 10 field demonstration sites in 6 mountainous countries. The project achieved a number of notable accomplishments, including the first snow leopard GPS tracking collar study in the eastern Himalayas, training of 220 citizen scientists, five new climate vulnerability assessments, six watershed management plans, launch of a long-term high altitude hydro-meteorological monitoring study, adoption of water smart technology by 2,141 households, 73% average increase in household incomes, 26,966 people attending conservation awareness events and trainings, establishment of 411,622 hectares of new protected areas, 1.4 million hectares of land brought under improved management, and guidance documents and training for development of climate-smart landscape management plans.'],\n",

The report examines the encroachment of oil palm plantations in the corridor, the owners, size, and productivity of the plantations, and the involvement of large private companies in their development. It also tracks the illicit FFB from the corridor to CPO mills and tainted CPO to ports. The investigation found that 19,000 ha of fully established oil palm plantations, 4,000 ha of newly cleared lands, and 9,000 ha of shrub were present in the corridor. The report highlights the chain-of-custody cases that show FFB and CPO can travel long distances for processing, potentially contaminating regions considered safe from illegal products.\"],\n",

To reverse this course, a Federal framework is needed to reduce unnecessary and problematic materials, with accompanying mechanisms for private and public investment and accountability in recycling systems. This 5-Point Roadmap to Materials Circularity seeks to address shortcomings related to the production, use, and disposal of plastics and other materials, and calls for corporate and government accountability, materials re-evaluation, and addressing financial incentives and designing for circularity.
