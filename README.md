# DSS-x-WWF
Our project goal was to visualize WWFâ€™s impact throughout the globe, as granular as possible. To do so, we received 279 project documents in PDF format and aimed to use LLMs to extract mentioned location and accomplishments, then map this information on an interactive map where user can toggle over a point and be redirected to more information on the project. Our methodology can be extended to other use cases that have similar needs of extracting project information that is previously locked away in PDFs!
## Our Timeline
1. Assess which PDFs are actually useful by manually filtering out PDFs that are not project documents (e.g. PDFs on origami instructions mixed into the same folder).  
2. Do initial experimentation using 6 different LLMs -- Mistral, Instructor, PaLM, Spacy, Jurassic2, OpenAI -- to extract information from a subset of 20 high-quality PDFs.
3. Score each LLMs's performance using our validation function to settle on the best one for our use case.
4. Apply the best LLM methodology on full set of 218 PDFs.
5. Create an interactive map with these results a searchbox function using Folium and Mapbox.
